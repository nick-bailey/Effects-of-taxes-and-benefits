# Effects-of-taxes-and-benefits

This repository contains R code to analyse a new data product from the Office for National Statistics, from its work in producing the annual 'Effects of Taxes and Benefits on Household Incomes'. For the first time in 2020, the aggregated data which underpin many of the figures in the statistical bulletin have been made available in a 'tidy' format, making re-use much simpler and more efficient. The R code reads in the data and runs produces some simple visualisations.
